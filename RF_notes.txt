Random Forest notes

- Had to use an imputer to get rid of nans in the age category. However I'm not sure that it is the most sensible way of dealing with them (mean, median and mode) I think this needs to be experimented with empirically

n=100 using all the training data 0.50916, this is below the all NDF scenario.

Again using n=100 doing a cross val on the training data it suggests that the accuracy has an average of 0.565932 (this is number of correct classifications/number of classifications).
Cross val was carried out 10 times and got the following results
[ 0.56737447,  0.5669177,  0.56475094,  0.56617983,  0.5656762,
 0.56459868,  0.56341575,  0.56610956,  0.56628524,  0.56801865]

Cross validation could also be used to work out some sparsity calculations, at what point does the number of training samples affect the accuracy, could then do an ROC curve based on training size.

I've now got code to standardize the input (although not the target). Not sure if this even makes sense for the job we're doing. All date stuff has been left out as I'm not sure how to encode it unless I make an arbitrary decision of minimum date = 1 and then depending on timedeltas the rest of the dates follow.

I haven't played around with hyperparameters, but the only one that makes sense is n_estimators.

It would be good to get an idea of the distribution of these decision trees. There is some code to do this however the input is only 2 dimensional. We could use MDS to get a representation and then colour background based on prediction and foreground on actual.

I also made a benchmark calculator, which calculates the accuracy (as defined above) when using only one country as the predicted variable. Obviously this is only done with the training dataset. The results are as follows:

NDF	0.583473
US 	0.292226
FR 	0.023532
IT 	0.013282
GB 	0.010888
ES 	0.010536
CA 	0.006690
DE 	0.004971
other	0.047290
NL 	0.003570
AU 	0.002525
PT 	0.001017

Do we need to create our own NDCG measure? All this work is only doing the first one whereas the competition allows multiple entries.
